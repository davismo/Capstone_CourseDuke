<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>At colleges all across the country, choosing courses, setting your schedule, and planning for your academic future can be one of the most stressful times for students and thatâ€™s all before a single book is picked up, any lectures are attended, or any exams have begun. With all of the stress that comes with being a college student, deciding which classes need to be a taken and in what order should does not have to be one of them. The purpose of this project is to create a web-based application that will allow students to input their academic information (such as intended major, minor, previous coursework, etc.) and then receive a detailed, interactive schedule and academic plan to help the student to plan for their future and stay on task throughout their collegiate career.</p>
